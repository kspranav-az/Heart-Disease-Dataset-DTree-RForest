#  Decision Trees and Random Forests

This project demonstrates the use of **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers for binary classification using the **Heart Disease Dataset**.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Learn and apply tree-based models for classification:
- Train a Decision Tree and visualize it
- Analyze overfitting by tuning tree depth
- Train a Random Forest and compare performance
- Interpret feature importances
- Evaluate with cross-validation

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Graphviz (optional for visualization)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Heart Disease Dataset**  
  Can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

## ðŸ§ª Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Train a Decision Tree Classifier
3. Visualize the decision tree (optional)
4. Train a Random Forest Classifier
5. Compare model accuracies
6. Interpret feature importances
7. Evaluate using cross-validation

## âœ… Outcome
- Random Forest outperforms a single Decision Tree in accuracy and generalization
- Important features influencing heart disease prediction identified
- Demonstrated impact of overfitting and how to control it

## ðŸ“Ž How to Run
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn graphviz
